# Ruby-ish methods for Objective-C

Intro
---------------------
This is a project for personal development to learn more about Objective-C and Ruby.

Next Improvements
---------------------
Finish the Specs for NSArray and continue to pick off classes and methods which are interesting to implement, and methods which might give some value to my every-day coding.

iOS Requirements / ARC Status
---------------------
requires iOS 5.0+, and is ARC enabled.

Tests
---------------------
Tests are provided through Expecta ( https://github.com/specta/expecta ), and are largely reproduced from the Ruby
Reference page ( http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/ ), some methods may be changed slightly
in how they function, but for the most part the goal is to ape Ruby behaviour.
